We planned an indoor mapping gps app that synchronize the phone location up to a 10 cm accuracy.

Finally we design an indorr tracker app using 2 Texas Instruments CC1350 launcpad boards over BLE protocol.

The app show you your track inside building for a 5 cm (!!) accuracy.

## Why ?

Up-to-date spatial data of indoor environments are needed in an increasing number of applications.

Optimized routing and navigation in large public buildings is one of the most needed application these days.

Lack of availability of GPS signals inside buildings makes indoor mapping and navigation a challenging issue.

InDoor Tracker is our solution for this problem
